# sentiment_analysis

How to see the result:

Since we already train the model and store it, thus you don't need to train our model again. By running the scitkit_svm_sentiment.py, you can see the result of baseline SVM

The data we feed to Tensorflow is stored in the folder call Training and Testing. In each folder we already have the clustered tweets stored in each folder. Inside each folder, we have rt-polarity.pos and rt-polarity.neg files, and they contains the tweets labeled as positive and negative, respectively.
