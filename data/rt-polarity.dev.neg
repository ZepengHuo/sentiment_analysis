@guardian " speak american " that may just sum up how stupid sarah palin is . i thought they spoke english in the us or a bastersised version . 
fantastic ! sarah palin demands that migrants to usa ' speak american ' . can't make this stuff up . 
hahaha - sarah palin wants immigrants to speak ' american ' . they don't make ' em much dumber than her - 
sarah palin says immigrants to the us should ' speak american ' . just think : she could have been the vice president 
today , republicans will talk about how much they appreciate workers . tomorrow they'll work to crush worker rights . #laborday sarah palin 
@realdonaldtrump i despise sarah palin . you may want her support , but she'll end up sinking you like she did mccain . proceed cautiously . 
saturday night live is going to have to find a new actress to play sarah palin , she's aged too much for tina fey to play her now . 
@amandapalmer methinks one of the things that god dumped may have hit sarah palin on her noggin 
sarah palin came out of a hole to let you know she's still shockingly ignorant 
in boxing a 1-2 punch means a potential knock out if george w bush was the 1st punch in america's face , we were lucky to escape sarah palin 
how does sarah palin stay so tan when she lives in a state that does not see sun 50% of the year ? 
the amount of people on facebook sharing the daily currant article about sarah palin is hilarious . ( guys , it's satire . c'mon people . ) 
@mjosephsheppard never said that the dems weren't mistake-prone . sarah palin is just patient zero for the stupid . in her defense gbw was 1st 
donald trump , sarah palin , and ted cruz are going to be speaking at the capitol tomorrow and i'll be in class . damn . 
@daxgyetmhanaak people wholeheartedly believing satire about sarah palin is what got her the reputation she has in the 1st place . 
maybe this judge is on to something .. unintended consequences to make scotus listen 
@petapup1 @s3nt13ntb31ng @saculsacul won't be the 1st time scotus violated the constitution & won't be the last . 
@politicallaughs @kesgardner besides i don't believe that scotus has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment 
@yowan @eyeamsmf however , i don't think today's scotus and fed govt would interpret the 9th that way . 9th & 10th have seemingly disappeared 
the 1st amendment is being ignored while the new federal right to marriage equality made up by scotus ( marriage ... 
and @whytology article 3 gives scotus no legislative powers and the 10th amendment is clear . the 14th sec 5 requires an act of congress . 
@jspoupart @joec1776 no . congress makes laws and the scotus settles disputes . in this case , the 1st amendment lost . 
thanks for hating america , scotus . i hope you all get cancer . ok , good talk . cc : @potus 
@realdonaldtrump disappointed on your comment on scotus using the 14th amend to void millions of legal votes by state citizens . sad usa 
suggestion - get familiar with 1st amendment . it pretty much strikes down all scotus rulings regarding gay marriage , holiday celebrations 
6th circuit & scotus denied #kimdavis appeals & upheld bunnings order , what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now ? 
it absolutely bothers the liberals that scotus ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended ! @cspanwj #pjnet #p2 
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 scotus violated the 10th amendment to the u.s. constitution not allowing #kimdavis #1a right 
@israel4911 @letha_hughes it was the 14th that scotus ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality . news not your strong subject . 
the scotus claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling . no matter how far you stretch it isn't there . 
@sniffjenkum scotus has no authority to make law . only congress may legislate . #separationofpowers #abuseofpower 
@cspanwj in their recent pro gay marriage decision , scotus has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the united states constitution . 
clerk #kimdavis is jailed because scotus can see gay marriage in the 14th amend . but fed . dist . judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st . 
1a : congress can't make law preventing religious freedom , so scotus interpretation unlawful const trumps case law 
@lrihendry @christiec733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4 . like our scotus , irving may flip on one vote . 
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack , which one do we chose ? oh yeah it's up to scotus and they ruled ! 
@stonecoldchik the panthers are advocating the killing of police , scotus says that " true threats are outside the 1st amendment so why aren't 
@alphakruse @suz123nj @papalputz @otterdose @matstaver scotus vitiated ky marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th amendment 
@thoughtsoftony @toddstarnes @shaephoenix hi tony . as usual u pick up the story at a convenient place in time . scotus imposed this on us 1st 
#kimdavis appealed bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and scotus denied the appeals why does she think it'll change now ? 
@cybrpete so speaks the " soulless zombie " who fails to grasp the scotus decision was based on the 14th amendment #tcot #constitution 
@larryoconnor @gretchencarlson u sound like the hated " smartset " now ? is #kimdavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from scotus in history ? 
huckabee claims scotus made new law on ssm . no . the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment is more than a century old . 
scotus cannot make law only rule on it . get real america . unless it's healthcare . then they feel they can . 
scotus apparently is saying that gays have an equal right to marriage under the 14th amendment . 
ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman , if scotus now writes law , guess ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish . 
@fixthecourt judge rules that he can not issue a divorce for same sex couple because of scotus decision . 
skimmed it may not like the scotus decision but it's the law . no offense , but your pope ? climate change ? seriously ? 
what's with this twitter account ? it's like the seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person . 
i told someone about how i once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me . 
@bgtennisnation serena can't fool me that 2nd set was a gift to venus . she didn't want to beat her in 2 easy sets . 
@hbryant42 venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let serena feel the pressure ; she let her off the hook , in a way . 
@davidjonesrc serena > venus yes . if asante samuel doesn't drop an easy int eli may not even be with giants anymore . you are eli #overrated 
may or may not have twisted my ankle reenacting serena vs . venus with my roommate last night . 
italian police stopped california rapper snoop dogg on friday as he prepared to board a private plane bound for ... 
after espn did that whole documentary for snoop dogg son , he quit the team before his 1st game . 
young buck may face five years in prison due to smoking marijuana with snoop dogg

snoop dogg cancelled his performance at the fair tomorrow ... turns out he had a prior commitment for mitch-a-palooza .
