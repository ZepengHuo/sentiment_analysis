@rednationrising @thedemocrats hey , turns out obama may be right about man made climate change destroying the planet after all #irandeal :-p 
i am not an american but i'm convinced that obama , the 11th president in my lifetime , is by far the best @potus

ric flair is also telling friends he may replace hogan on #toughenough 
i would like to see docs on british bulldog , ric flair's 16 title wins & the royal rumble match . #documentthiswwe 
triple h was never ric flair's bitch , but sunday cena will make rollins his . wow #raw 
* whispers * ric flair is at least a seventeen time world champion . john cena won't tie him if he wins on sunday . 
" he may be aiming for ric flair , but comes off more like billy gunn " ~ anonymous wwe veteran in pwi about dolph ziggler . wow . 
who so ever hate you doesn't matter . i know that you will be the 16th time champ . and hope you will break ric flair's record . nevergiveup 
@wwe ready to see @johncena win the championship for the 16th time . tying the legend ric flair 
he needs to walk tomorrow , flip the bat and begin strutting like ric flair 
i hope that when @ronfunches wins @midnight for the 16th time , ric flair comes out to congratulate him . unless jon stewart interferes . 
if @mscharlottewwe defeats nikki bella at #nightofchampions , it should be similar to how ric flair beat dusty rhodes to win his 1st title 
the notion nikki doesn't " deserve " to break the record is laughable . aj wasn't ric flair . hell , nikki may be better now than aj ever was . 
personally , i like rick perry and appreciate what he did for texas . but as president ... dunno . he may start a war by mispronouncing something 
@ohwowhmm i'll vote for either ted cruz or rick perry , whichever one is the 1st to declare their state as the " home of 3 first round picks " 
rick perry succeeded with 12th largest economy in the world texas he will be a successful president for all american 
good for the des moines register and good for rick perry . he will make you all proud . 
better take another look at rick perry . best record in the 12th largest world economy . aaa rating . 
i hear rick perry is gleefully almost beside himself with joy today , as the 1st fully formed human brain nears completion . #upgrade 
rick perry has a great record of solving problems in the 12th largest economy worldwide . others have plans only 
rick perry is amazing . his speech was the best hands down . #perry2016 
lol . i am quit sure that isn't the future 4 rick perry . he is the 1 that will give us back what we lost . we need him 
rt : u can't keep him down .. rick perry may not have the most money , but has the most active grass roots .. 
former gov . rick perry said wednesday financial woes won't be the death knell for his second bid for the white house : 
@rbpundit i really like rick perry , but rubio is my strong 2nd choice , where can i read about his immigration policy ? 
obama gets iran victory , tabor gets another black eye , & rick perry prepares for the end . #copolitics #copols #coleg 
in 14 years gov . rick perry's conservative principles madetx the 12th largest global economy 
if rick perry does not win the election , he has lost nothing as he is a strong family man , and a true christian . 
contrary to what you may have heard in the media , rick perry has a loyal , dedicated team that is committed to ... 
14yrs rick perry ran the 12th largest economy in the world , left with 18bil surplus 27mill people & created all of the job growth in america ! 
@magicalvidyacat seems fitting that there's a parallel there , and that scotus used 14th amendment to override the 10th . @rinaxas 
@a10jim @ninaland @woodhullsfa and that's why scotus has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce . hence " supreme court . " 
@chrisbraly scotus never made law they interpreted it . 14th a guarantees equal rights for all americans 
seinfeld may have not known it at the time . but he made the last sitcom that mattered . 
@lupeo1219 well seinfeld is like the sun of comedies . :p 
kramer is the best character on seinfeld . george close second , newman 3rd . 
someone needs to make a video compilation of all the sat vocabulary cosmo kramer spontaneously uses on seinfeld 
which on its surface may seem counterintuitive , but the marginal utility of seinfeld obviously increases at an increasing rate . 
. @zachlowe_nba the blazers have been cemented as my new 2nd-fave team based solely on how much of a seinfeld fan neil olshey is . #cartwright 
this may be the greatest thing i've seen in awhile , just because seinfeld is the greatest show 
seinfeld may be the only thing i care about anymore 
seinfeld's " the contest " may just be one of the best episodes ... #andthenthereweretwo 
@kanani_lol what a waste . it even has the last man on earth , seinfeld , south park and monday night raw . hulu is awesome 
@nacho2813 @joe_schmucc but he is shirking the gap between him and eddie year by year . no one is catching seinfeld , but he may catch eddie . 
@sigridellis i may have read that in the way that seinfeld greeted newman . 
interested to see what kind of ratings the u.s. open final gets on saturday with serena presumably going for history up against cfb . 
and with serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister venus 
history still in the making with serena's win over sister venus ! #grandslam 
serena just needs to win two more matches to win the last 5 majors/4 in a single year/last 4 us opens 
serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #usopen in a row . two more matches to complete the grand slam . 
serena won , but big sister venus gave her the flux ! congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match . 
@jon_wertheim @benrothenberg it played out like serena took off the 2nd set . an in form vika might make her pay . might . 
dem born venus come born serena on top . blessings on blessings on blessings .... may our children always excel and make us proud #usopen 
happy for serena . i want her to win the 22nd gs , tie steffi and win the cygs . @usopen #usopen 
answer : moi . question : who's seeing serena play in the semifinals on thursday ? 
serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better . that good #serenavsvenus 
sisterly love : after beating older sis venus in 3rd set match at @usopen , serena says , " she's the best person i know . " ( cc : @alexa_pollock ) 
" @sportscenter : serena remains on top ! the younger williams bts venus in the sisters ' 14th gs matchup , 6-2 , 1-6 , 6-3 . 
serena won . the cubs are winning in st. louis . i'm enjoying sports lately . too bad the bears play this sunday . 
serena williams has won her 16th match over venus williams tonight . serena attempts to reach the grand slam with ... 
u.s. open features familiar matchup as serena and venus williams meet for the 27th time @realsway 
serena dominated in the end , a tough match for the win ! 
@nerdywonka @terri_georgia my feeling serena could win 2 straight set , but as a respect2 venus and viewers she let venus 2win 2nd set 
serena beat her sister venus in the quarter finals . she is 2 matches away to the 4th successive grand slam in a row #usopen2015 
venus was serving and passing better , but she donated some ufes in the 3rd set . serena played the big points better for the win . #usopen2015 
@omojuwa serena won her q/final match against venus . she will play unseeded italian roberta vinci in the semis on thursday #usopen2015 
@nytimes bitter /sweet - serena may almost not have wanted to win . but - their father richard always taught them , to do the best they can . 
couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see serena beat venus . what a resilient , tough player venus is , tho . 
serena's 1st and 3rd set were gracious , especially when she hit the split and slammed it at the end of the 1st set . sheesh ! 
see win% on 1st serve for serena : get more than the #usopen tennis score with #ibmsports . 
did u see the aces she had during that 2nd set against serena , venus still got it folks @usopen @serenawilliams @venuseswilliams @rogerandjp 
completely agree @dandakich serena tanked the 2nd set to let venus win one and then she turned it up 
yesterday venus and serena williams faced off for the 5th time in the us open quarter finals . here's what serena ...
