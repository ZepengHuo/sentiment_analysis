i think a big part of rick perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around . may be jeb's downfall too . 
rick perry may have to drop out of the race , before one vote is cast , because he has run out of money . i have mixed feelings about that .

when sarah palin and donald trump speak for america , i think it may be time for a new revolution .

this sounds like when sarah palin was interviewed and didn't know the answer . claimed she was being set up . 
why in god's name would cnn have sarah palin on tomorrow ? there's no one else from alaska who can talk about obama's visit ?

someone may want to let sarah palin know that american is a nationality , while english is a language . 
it's possible sarah palin may be more of a moron than trump .. they said it was impossible 
how is sarah palin still in politics . she was and still is the embarrassment of the gop , but she may be out done by some douche & his toupee 
some low hanging monday fruit : " sarah palin says immigrants to the us should ' speak american '" 
sarah palin says us immigrants should speak " american " , does she mean navajo or sioux ? 
sarah palin says us immigrants should ' speak american ' < errrr she means english right ? 
@guardian " speak american " that may just sum up how stupid sarah palin is . i thought they spoke english in the us or a bastersised version . 
fantastic ! sarah palin demands that migrants to usa ' speak american ' . can't make this stuff up . 
hahaha - sarah palin wants immigrants to speak ' american ' . they don't make ' em much dumber than her - 
sarah palin says immigrants to the us should ' speak american ' . just think : she could have been the vice president

@petapup1 @s3nt13ntb31ng @saculsacul won't be the 1st time scotus violated the constitution & won't be the last . 
@politicallaughs @kesgardner besides i don't believe that scotus has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment 
the 1st amendment is being ignored while the new federal right to marriage equality made up by scotus ( marriage ... 
and @whytology article 3 gives scotus no legislative powers and the 10th amendment is clear . the 14th sec 5 requires an act of congress . 
@jspoupart @joec1776 no . congress makes laws and the scotus settles disputes . in this case , the 1st amendment lost . 
@realdonaldtrump disappointed on your comment on scotus using the 14th amend to void millions of legal votes by state citizens . sad usa 
suggestion - get familiar with 1st amendment . it pretty much strikes down all scotus rulings regarding gay marriage , holiday celebrations 
6th circuit & scotus denied #kimdavis appeals & upheld bunnings order , what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now ? 
it absolutely bothers the liberals that scotus ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended ! @cspanwj #pjnet #p2 
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 scotus violated the 10th amendment to the u.s. constitution not allowing #kimdavis #1a right 
@israel4911 @letha_hughes it was the 14th that scotus ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality . news not your strong subject . 
the scotus claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling . no matter how far you stretch it isn't there . 
@sniffjenkum scotus has no authority to make law . only congress may legislate . #separationofpowers #abuseofpower 
@cspanwj in their recent pro gay marriage decision , scotus has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the united states constitution . 
clerk #kimdavis is jailed because scotus can see gay marriage in the 14th amend . but fed . dist . judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st . 
1a : congress can't make law preventing religious freedom , so scotus interpretation unlawful const trumps case law 
@lrihendry @christiec733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4 . like our scotus , irving may flip on one vote . 
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack , which one do we chose ? oh yeah it's up to scotus and they ruled ! 
@stonecoldchik the panthers are advocating the killing of police , scotus says that " true threats are outside the 1st amendment so why aren't 
@alphakruse @suz123nj @papalputz @otterdose @matstaver scotus vitiated ky marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th amendment 
@thoughtsoftony @toddstarnes @shaephoenix hi tony . as usual u pick up the story at a convenient place in time . scotus imposed this on us 1st 
#kimdavis appealed bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and scotus denied the appeals why does she think it'll change now ? 
@cybrpete so speaks the " soulless zombie " who fails to grasp the scotus decision was based on the 14th amendment #tcot #constitution 
@larryoconnor @gretchencarlson u sound like the hated " smartset " now ? is #kimdavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from scotus in history ? 
huckabee claims scotus made new law on ssm . no . the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment is more than a century old . 
scotus cannot make law only rule on it . get real america . unless it's healthcare . then they feel they can . 
scotus apparently is saying that gays have an equal right to marriage under the 14th amendment . 
ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman , if scotus now writes law , guess ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish . 
@fixthecourt judge rules that he can not issue a divorce for same sex couple because of scotus decision . 
skimmed it may not like the scotus decision but it's the law . no offense , but your pope ? climate change ? seriously ? 
@bgtennisnation serena can't fool me that 2nd set was a gift to venus . she didn't want to beat her in 2 easy sets .
