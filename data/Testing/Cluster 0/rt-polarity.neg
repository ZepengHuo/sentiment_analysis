@repmikepompeo mike i think you are a large piece of cow dung ! fda may have approved gmo's but sir you must be in bed with monsanto . koch 
did it ever occur to anyone monsanto may be executing honey bees w/ poison " round up " to control food supply by limiting natural foods ?? 
@blisstabitha i would bet that monsanto factors into this somehow ! obvious they want to control the food supply even if it may cause cancer 
@gmwatch @repmikepompeo @marcorubio @senbillnelson please explain why you support monsanto ! 
why in the name of monsanto am i sitting @ home on saturday night trolling for used rvs on craigslist .. oh yeah , i have no date . #fuckallyall 
march against monsanto is now just , " hey , let's try to see how much pseudoscience we can spout out ! " jumping on chemtrails and big pharma . 
pissed bc i fell asleep watching netflix without my wifi turned on and now i only have 90% of my data left and it restarts the 20th

netflix and sleep . i have to get up early tomorrow and i don't want to . i'm still recovering from t . swift .

it's saturday night in vegas . i'm stuck with no clothes . wonder if i can go out and have a good time in my nike gym outfit ? @southwestair 
my little brother comes home with nike elite socks and jordans , when i was in 6th grade i got wilson socks and clearance shoes from olympia 
nike didn't have what i needed so now i need to order it online and i need it tomorrow ihml

@yuriofwind nintendo should stop making mario party and make golden sun 4 baby . ... i'll see myself out . 
@the_moviebob nintendo is not going to change like every other system they promise 3rd party support and never deliver on it . 
@lumiaus the 1520 is the first nokia i have ever had break on me . 1st . the phone stops reading the micro sim card 
mom this case may be one of the most strongest cases possible but it feels like holding and using a fucking nokia ! 
obama to cameron : who taught you to draw up a kill list ? cameron : you , alright ? i learned it from watching you 
debating on skipping class tomorrow bc i don't wanna deal with all the crazy people bc obama

big rally tomorrow , again it looks like too little , too late . where was everyone before kerry and obama f'ed up ? 
follow the money . some of that $150b release to iran is going to an obama account ! think about it . 
@mmeans68 i spoke with trumps campaign today . i told them colleges . thats how obama won & carson moving up . got email iowa st sat . i said bring 
as far as i am concerned you murdered stevens with obama's help . bring him down and your sentence may be lighter . you played part in murder 
oracle so transparently bought sun just to sue the fuck out of me . 
oracle is the worst thing that ever happened to sun and solaris . full stop . 
i'm still sad that sun is gone . and who was the genius that sold them to oracle ? that's like letting darth vader babysit your kids . 
it's friday night and i'm learning about oracle sql developer . sort it out daniel , i should be getting drunk . 
@angryref on 2nd thought , i would have 2 cute kitties and you could have my cnbc obsessed , oracle employed , somewhat grumpy husband , deal ! 
whoever decided how oracle does date arithmetic is getting kicked into the sun . 
my sister wants me to workout with her at the crack of dawn tomorrow in oracle ... 
it would be refreshing for cnn to give as much attention to the monsters at planned parenthood as you are to a panda 
love my @nro , but 1st item under the week in 8/24 issue about planned parenthood scandal was beneath you . i expect a little more , friends . 
congress will hold its first hearing on the planned parenthood controversy . guess who wasn't invited to testify ? 
the pope is being a bae again , but i feel like the catholic church could be giving more to relevant charities . 
@michael_nutter like how are ppl supposed to pay rent ? should i ask the pope on the 26th when he comes ? 
was a part of it , still crying , still saying goodbye ... ric flair may you live forever ... way too much loss lately :( 
. @johncena legendary killing on mic @wwerollins " triple h was never ric flair bitchh this sunday i make you mine " #raw #titlefortitle #ngu 
@iowahawkblog @jpodhoretz i went to texas a&m but oddly never met rick perry . i think he may have spent that year in pakistan . 
@nanjmay6478 i used to really like rick perry , just has become so bitter . he may be very sad . he should try to smile 
@motherjones @berniesandersct looked like rick perry ! let's see what the nj hypocrite j . scarborough has to say about this monday morning ? 
@sharonlsandoval @realdonaldtrump bet you haven't donated much to rick perry , if at all . he's a loser & someone has to be the 1st to go out . 
i swear watching that interview just made me wanna throw sarah palin and trump in a rocket to the sun 
i'd say this makes me think of sarah palin's " i can see russia " moment , but that's basically the whole gop . 
pls cnn why in a world u bring this idiot sarah palin on sunday great news program state of the union cnn u really fuck up my sunday 
my gods , sarah palin is genuinely crazy , isn't she ... 
watching sarah palin telling people to speak " american " was the highlight of my sunday . that was some classic self destruction . 
shouldn't sarah palin be putting her little mind onto maters such as ' who is the baby daddy for my 4th grandbaby ?? 
sarah palin got french & spanish " all mixed up " in high school . she would , wouldn't she . . 
today , republicans will talk about how much they appreciate workers . tomorrow they'll work to crush worker rights . #laborday sarah palin 
saturday night live is going to have to find a new actress to play sarah palin , she's aged too much for tina fey to play her now . 
sarah palin came out of a hole to let you know she's still shockingly ignorant 
maybe this judge is on to something .. unintended consequences to make scotus listen 
thanks for hating america , scotus . i hope you all get cancer . ok , good talk . cc : @potus 
what's with this twitter account ? it's like the seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person . 
i told someone about how i once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me . 
may or may not have twisted my ankle reenacting serena vs . venus with my roommate last night . 
no snoop dogg tomorrow , out with illness . i was really looking forward to snoop after classes tomorrow . it's how this day just went today ..
